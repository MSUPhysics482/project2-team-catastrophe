Anna and Josh, I'm still a bit unclear about what you are planning to do, so I'm hoping that the next project problem helps illuminate what you intend to do. I think there's a lot here, but I don't want to prescribe anything, so it will take some work on your part to look into it. Your timeline has enough detail to let me know that you will have plenty of space to explore this, but I'm worried about your spinning your wheels for too long exploring things that you will be pressured to finish this at the end of the semester.

Anna and Josh, I think it's great that you want to push on the Maxwell stress tensor a bit and see where it goes. I think you probably have something that is a bit too narrowly scoped, but it will involve you both doing a bit of learning about the tensor itself and what it means, so I'm ok with that. I do want to remind you that this is meant to be both an analytical project and a computational one, so thinking about how to take the problem you will use to illustrate what you have done and make something that is computationally tractable will be an important thing to do in this project.
