Anna and Josh, you are making up quick progress on the work that you need to. I think you have a good plan going forward and that the progress you've made on writing your code is admirable givent hat you changed your topic so late. Investgating the inverse piexo-electric effect is a great idea and I can see that the code appears to be set up to start modeling it. I haven't installed the hoomd package just yet, so I'll trust what you've done. I will install it later this week and try to play with your code a bit. Great work so far.

Anna and Josh, I'm glad to see that you found something you are more interested in. I think you are going to really think about what the model describes because while you have discussed the specific variables in it, you haven't really explained the model itself in detail. Also, I'm curious what you will model with the computer in this case as well. What do you plan to explore in this model? I'm glad to see that you are sharing the work equally and that you have a good collaboration going.

Anna and Josh, I'm still a bit unclear about what you are planning to do, so I'm hoping that the next project problem helps illuminate what you intend to do. I think there's a lot here, but I don't want to prescribe anything, so it will take some work on your part to look into it. Your timeline has enough detail to let me know that you will have plenty of space to explore this, but I'm worried about your spinning your wheels for too long exploring things that you will be pressured to finish this at the end of the semester.

Anna and Josh, I think it's great that you want to push on the Maxwell stress tensor a bit and see where it goes. I think you probably have something that is a bit too narrowly scoped, but it will involve you both doing a bit of learning about the tensor itself and what it means, so I'm ok with that. I do want to remind you that this is meant to be both an analytical project and a computational one, so thinking about how to take the problem you will use to illustrate what you have done and make something that is computationally tractable will be an important thing to do in this project.
