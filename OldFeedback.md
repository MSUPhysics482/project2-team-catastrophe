## HW 8; Score: 16/20

Anna and Josh, I think it's great that you want to push on the Maxwell stress tensor a bit and see where it goes. I think you probably have something that is a bit too narrowly scoped, but it will involve you both doing a bit of learning about the tensor itself and what it means, so I'm ok with that. I do want to remind you that this is meant to be both an analytical project and a computational one, so thinking about how to take the problem you will use to illustrate what you have done and make something that is computationally tractable will be an important thing to do in this project.
