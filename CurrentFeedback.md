## HW12; Score: 16/20

Anna and Josh, it looks like you have a good layout for your poster and that you are both working on different parts of the project. It would be nice if you could both work on the code in a bit more colalborative fashion. I understand that Josh has more experience with hoomd, but it would be important for Anna to understand the details as well (as both of you are presenting your poster!). From the notebook, it appears that you have made some deewnt progress, but that there's a piece of straining the lattive that you need to finish, which judging from the notebook is not yet implemented, right? Does hoomd do that or is that something you have to do by hand? Either way, it will be important to explain how that gets implemented (i.e., explain how the strain results in field changes) on your poster.
