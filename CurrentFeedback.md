## HW9; Score: 16/20

Anna and Josh, I'm still a bit unclear about what you are planning to do, so I'm hoping that the next project problem helps illuminate what you intend to do. I think there's a lot here, but I don't want to prescribe anything, so it will take some work on your part to look into it. Your timeline has enough detail to let me know that you will have plenty of space to explore this, but I'm worried about your spinning your wheels for too long exploring things that you will be pressured to finish this at the end of the semester.
