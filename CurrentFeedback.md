Anna and Josh, you are making up quick progress on the work that you need to. I think you have a good plan going forward and that the progress you've made on writing your code is admirable givent hat you changed your topic so late. Investgating the inverse piexo-electric effect is a great idea and I can see that the code appears to be set up to start modeling it. I haven't installed the hoomd package just yet, so I'll trust what you've done. I will install it later this week and try to play with your code a bit. Great work so far.
