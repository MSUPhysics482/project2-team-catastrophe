## HW10; Score: 16/20

Anna and Josh, I'm glad to see that you found something you are more interested in. I think you are going to really think about what the model describes because while you have discussed the specific variables in it, you haven't really explained the model itself in detail. Also, I'm curious what you will model with the computer in this case as well. What do you plan to explore in this model? I'm glad to see that you are sharing the work equally and that you have a good collaboration going.
