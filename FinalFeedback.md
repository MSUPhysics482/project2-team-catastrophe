## HW13; Score: 20/20

Anna and Josh, thanks for taking this seriously and making this really nice final question list!

The current computational model will include a dipole interaction between particles as the leading order term and a second order term using the Lennard-Jones potential. Do you think that LJ potential is needed? The dipole pair interaction provides a gross approximation for Weiss domains.
-If you have time, the LJ addition will be cool, but not essential. What wouls be cooler is comparing the leading order solution to the corrected solution! What does it correct for and how is it born out?!


HOOMD may not produce visible effects in terms of the lattice distortion, however it will spit out a field energy. Do you think that graphs of energy vs term as the lattice equilibrates and the 3D image of the initial lattice configuration are sufficient?
Yes, I do. I think your explanation of these goes a long way. Remember that you are the experts on this and you will be sharing this with your classmates not just me. So don't overshoot too much, something novel will be worthwhile.

As far as our ‘big picture’ goes, we want to show that it is possible to use Monte Carlo sampling to model the inverse piezoelectric effect. Our approach is basically to say that the initial pair energy is zero between all points, now after we apply an electric field to the system, the particles will strain in some way, and this pairwise energy will be nonzero. Do you feel like this energy is a good, albeit general, approximation to the inverse piezoelectric effect?
I think it's ok, but the proof will be in the pudding. That is, how close do you get to modeling the real effect. Monte Carlo techniques often feel magical, so to the extent that you can conceptually imlluminate the approach for your classmates that's more important.


What else should we include in our poster besides our computational model? Perhaps we could add some details about experimental procedures regarding the piezoelectric effect, consider we work on SAW transducers in our lab?
- If you want, that's fine, but really think about your audience (moresly other students in our class), what are the things needed on the poster for them to understand (a) the system, (b) the physical model, (c) the technique for modeling, and (d) the results. It's probably a lot more than you had initially planned!


If this were for a graduate project, what types of critical questions would you ask about our simulation? (Note: We probably don’t have answers, but fun to think about.)
- Here's a few: How do you know that the Monte Carlo technique is the right approach for this problem? What makes it so? How does this technique model the real physical process? What's probabilistic in this physical system and why?

Do you personally find the work we are doing interesting, or would our poster be something that you might just stop by and say ‘oh neat’ at, and what are some things we could do to improve upon its appeal?
- I think it really depends on the audience. I'm interested because yours is one of the few using a sophisticated technique to do the modeling, so I want to learn more about how that works, but posters are tricky business in that respect. It's also about the pitch (think about the 30s, 2 minute, and 10 minute explanation of your poster).
