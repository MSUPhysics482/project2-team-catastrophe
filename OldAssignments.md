# HW-9 Paired Project Problem - Planning your project

After reviewing the feedback you received on your project idea, work with your partner to consider the plan for the next 5 weeks. In doing this answer  the question: How do you intend to structure the work? Explain the details of what will be done and who will be doing what. The expectation is that you have written 2-3 paragraphs describing the work and a detailed timeline. Where applicable you should also describe the roles and responsbilities of each member of the group at different points in the timeline.

## HW-8 Paired Project Problem - Starting your pair project

This second project can (but doesn't have to) build on the project you just complted. It is a team project that you will complete with a partner. This project is meant to mimic the common practice of poster preparation and presentation. In a nutshell, you will conduct an original modeling project where you analytically and computationally model some E&M phenomenon of your choosing, prepare a poster of the project, and present it to your classmates and me. In working on this project, you will be trying to answer the following questions:

* What is the area of E&M that you are doing research on?
* What are the questions that you are trying to answer about this area?
* What theoretical models can be used to answer those questions?
* What analytical and computational work did you do to answer those questions?
* What were the resulting predictions that your work produced?
* What are the limitations of what you have done? * What are some remaining open questions?
* What did each member of your pair contribute?

There will be six homework problems to help scaffold your work and poster development. In this first homework problem, you and your partner will write up a single document that answers the following questions:

* Who are the partners in this team?
* What are you and your partner proposing to do?
* What area of E&M will you be conducting original calculations for?
* What source material are you drawing from?
* What has been done so far and what are you going to do? It's ok if it's a solved problem, but you will need to reproduce what has been done and extend it beyond what your reference material offers.
